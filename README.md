# Calmness Theme Color 
A Visual Studio Code theme color that brings the feel and look from Intellij Idea default theme color. With slight modification on the workbench to make it's more calm and pleasing to the eyes.

## Recomended Icon Theme 
In my opinion, if you want full calmness I recommend using Sky Light Icon Theme for Visual Studio Code to complement this theme color.
